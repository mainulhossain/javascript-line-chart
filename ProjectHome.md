Although there are a number of libraries available for charts and graph including Google Chart API, most of them are server based. You have to send some configuration data to the server and get an image file as response. Unfortunately, image file is not very interactive. This project should develop a library which draws the graph dynamically on the browser and the user can manipulate them interactively.
